This directory should contain the relevant census files which can be downloaded from here:
census.hackshackers.co.za/static/indicators.tgz
census.hackshackers.co.za/static/subplaces.tgz

These commands should do the right thing:

wget -O - census.hackshackers.co.za/static/indicators.tgz | tar -zx
wget -O - census.hackshackers.co.za/static/subplaces.tgz | tar -zx
